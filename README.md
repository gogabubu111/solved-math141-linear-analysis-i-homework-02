 <li>Vectors<em>~v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>~v</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em>w~ </em>are given in the picture below. Use graphical method only (drawing pictures), without any numerical calculation, to determine whether <em>w~ </em>a linear combination of <em>~v</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>~v</em><sub>2</sub>. If not, why not? If yes, estimate the value of the scalars in front of <em>~v</em><sub>1 </sub>and <em>~v</em><sub>2 </sub></li>

 <li>Find the amount of gas used by each of the two cars. The first car gets 30 miles/gallon and the secondcar gets 21 miles/gallon. The total amount of gas used by both cars is 600 gallons and the total distance traveled by both cars is 16200 miles.</li>

 <li>Is it still possible to reach Old Man Gauss if you are given each of the following modes of transportationin stead of the hover board and magic carpet? Write a convincing argument that justify your conclusion. Use sentences, calculations, pictures, and anything that helps support your justification.
